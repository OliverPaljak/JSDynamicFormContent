# JSDynamicFormContent
Get form data with vanilla JavaScript.

JSDynamicFormContent doesn't use AJAX or other 'server-side' technologies. Its only goal is to get form data dynamically.

## What are JSDynamicFormContent current features?
JSDynamicFormContent:
1. gets form data and displays it dynamically (duh)
2. works with all form input elements (also with `<select>` and `<textarea>`). Also the input elements can be specifically set.
3. recognizes `required` attribute and shows an error message when one of required fields is empty.
4. recognizes `multiple` attribute and displays it as a list.
5. shows customizable "empty value" message when (not required) input field is empty
